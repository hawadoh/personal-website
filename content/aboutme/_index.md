### 👤 Basics

🎂 **Birthday:** 14 Dec 2004 (Sagittarius).

📐 **MBTI:** [INTJ-A](https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality) (Architect).

🔮 **[The Chariot (VII)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chariot_(tarot_card)):** My first ever tarot draw from the Major Arcana. I don't see tarot as fortune-telling, but as a mirror - a reflection of where you are, not where you'll end up. The Chariot shows a lone warrior leaving the safety of the city, guided by black and white sphinxes, opposing forces without reins. Control here isn't about force; it's about inner discipline, about steering chaos through willpower alone.

For me, The Chariot is about discipline, pursuit, and momentum: the reminder that to stop is to regress, and there's no real ending to the journey. The Chariot always moves forward.

### 🎒 Stories

**Kindergarten (age 4):** Once led a group of unsupervised kids back to the tutoring centre in Macau after the tutor vanished. They all snitched on me, but my parents were proud! My first taste of leadership and betrayal.

**Minecraft:** Used to be ranked #3 in Hypixel Ranked Skywars when I was 13. Minecraft PvP taught me more about pressure and strategy than school ever did.

**League of Legends:** Playing it for 8 years built my emotional calluses. After enough crushing defeats, I learned that tilting only digs the hole deeper. It ended up making me emotionally steadier, almost stoic, both in-game and in life.

### ⚡ Hobbies

**Gym:** Currently on a cut, tracking lifts and macros like an IFBB pro (400-500 caloric deficit). Strong pound-for-pound, but aesthetics-wise, no gifted genetics whatsoever. Although my size isn't convincing yet, I'm always down for a conversation about my training philosophy.

**Tea:** I'm not a coffee guy. Grew up around tea drinkers, and now I nerd out over oolong and high-mountain teas.

**Anime:** *JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure* (season 2 in particular!) & *Cyberpunk: Edgerunners*.

**Shows:** *The Blacklist*, *Breaking Bad*, *Better Call Saul*, *Altered Carbon*, *Cowboy Bebop*. Honestly, I've watched too many shows and films to count so this list will keep growing as they come to mind.

**Music:**
- **Jay Chou:** fan for 10+ years, but still haven’t been to a concert (someone put me on please). Sing anything by him and I’ll know the song and album instantly like Shazam.
- **The Weeknd:** Dawn FM on repeat (spacey, melancholic, perfect for late nights) and My Dear Melancholy for when the vocals need to hit hard.
- **SKAI ISYOURGOD:** recent discovery, on heavy rotation. Got a [playlist](https://tidal.com/playlist/355f86c1-ed69-45cf-a7e4-63fbf359149b) on TIDAL, repping Canton.
- …and way too many others to list (about 50 from NCS alone).

### 🌍 Random facts

I was born and raised in Macau, and I moved to the UK at 13. Now permanently split across multiple places I call home (🇲🇴 Macau, 🇭🇰 Hong Kong, 🇬🇧 the UK, and 🇨🇦 Canada).

I'm trilingual: Cantonese at home, English in my daily life, Mandarin when required. My dad's still disappointed I never picked up Hakka.

I can play the violin! Though I haven't picked it up in ages. I was a child prodigy at torturing people's ears. Maybe one day I'll redeem myself.

I've had severe myopia (-5.50) and astigmatism from a young age, which makes Everest plans… interesting.
