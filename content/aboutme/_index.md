### 👤 Basics

🎂 **Birthday:** 14 Dec (Sagittarius).

📐 **MBTI:** [INTJ-A](https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality) (Architect).

🔮 **[The Chariot (VII)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chariot_(tarot_card)):** My first ever tarot draw from the Major Arcana. I don't see tarot as fortune-telling, but as a mirror - a reflection of where you are, not where you'll end up.

The Chariot shows a lone warrior leaving the safety of the city, guided by black and white sphinxes. He *steers* these opposing forces without any reins. He's not controlling them completely, but redirecting their energy toward a chosen destination.

Control here isn't about force; rather, it is the ability to hold your centre while riding the chaos. For me, The Chariot is about discipline, pursuit, and momentum. It reminds that to stop is to regress, and there's no real ending to the journey.

The Chariot always moves forward, because motion itself is what keeps opposing forces in harmony: ambition and doubt, order and chaos, fear and courage. This balance is what keeps your inner war from consuming you.

### 🎒 Stories

**Kindergarten (age 4):** Once led a group of unsupervised kids back to the tutoring centre in Macau after the tutor vanished. They all snitched on me, but my parents were proud! My first taste of leadership and betrayal.

**Minecraft:** Used to be #3 on the Hypixel Ranked Skywars leaderboard when I was 13. Minecraft PvP taught me more about pressure and strategy than school ever did.

**League of Legends:** Playing it for 8 years built my emotional calluses. After enough crushing defeats, I learned that tilting only digs the hole deeper. It ended up making me emotionally steadier, almost stoic, both in-game and in life.

<!-- ### ⚡ Hobbies

**Gym:** Currently on a cut, tracking lifts and macros like an IFBB pro (400-500 caloric deficit). Strong pound-for-pound, but aesthetics-wise, no gifted genetics whatsoever. Although my size isn't convincing yet, I'm always down for a conversation about my training philosophy.

**Tea:** I'm not a coffee guy. Grew up around tea drinkers, and now I nerd out over all kind of loose-leaf teas.

**Anime:** *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure* (season 2 in particular!) & *Cyberpunk: Edgerunners*.

**Shows:** *The Blacklist*, *Breaking Bad*, *Better Call Saul*, *Altered Carbon*, *Cowboy Bebop*. Honestly, I've watched too many shows and films to count so this list will keep growing as they come to mind.

**Games:** *Minecraft*, *Red Dead Redemption 2*, *Cyberpunk 2077*, *League of Legends*, *Sifu*, *SOMA*, *Darkwood*, *The Longing*, *Scorn*. Anything fun/cerebral.

**Music:**
- **Jay Chou:** fan for 10+ years, but still haven't been to a concert (someone put me on please). Sing anything by him and I'll know the song and album instantly like Shazam.
- **The Weeknd:** *Dawn FM* on repeat (spacey, melancholic, perfect for late nights) and *My Dear Melancholy,* for when the vocals need to hit hard.
- **SKAI ISYOURGOD:** recent discovery, on heavy rotation. Got a [playlist](https://tidal.com/playlist/355f86c1-ed69-45cf-a7e4-63fbf359149b) on TIDAL, repping Canton.
- **Tame Impala:** *The Slow Rush* and *Currents*.
- **Deftones.**
- …and way too many others to list (about 50 from NCS alone). -->

### 🌍 Random facts

I was born and raised in Macau, and I moved to the UK at 13. Now permanently split across multiple places I call home (🇲🇴 Macau, 🇭🇰 Hong Kong, 🇬🇧 the UK, and 🇨🇦 Canada).

I'm trilingual: Cantonese at home, English in my daily life, Mandarin when required. My dad's still disappointed I never picked up Hakka.

I can play the violin! Though I haven't picked it up in ages. I was a child prodigy at torturing people's ears. Maybe one day I'll redeem myself.

I've had severe myopia (-5.50) and astigmatism from a young age, which makes Everest plans… interesting.

### 🌌 My answers to the big questions

Decided to add this part after being asked these questions in a street interview.

#### 🏆 Success
**"What is your definition of success?"**

> Success is when your work outlives your name.

<details>
<summary>Read my full answer</summary>

<br>

Success is not easy to define directly, but to me, its opposite is simple - failure is leaving regrets on the table, knowing you could have done better. By inversion, success is when you have pushed as far as you could, leaving nothing undone. It is when you have played the cards you were dealt to the best of your ability.

To me, true success is when your work outlives your name. Most of us live around eighty years, and here is a sobering thought: *do you know your great-grandparent's name?* Most people don't. In a hundred years, it is likely no one will remember who you were. That is why your work, your ideas, your values, and your stories matter infinitely more than your DNA.

The true extension of life is not biological but intellectual. DNA halves every generation - your child carries half, your grandchild one quarter, then one eighth, approaching zero with frightening speed. But ideas can live forever. Confucius is the perfect example. His bloodline has diluted to dust, yet his ideas are still relevant today.

The same is true in science. You probably do not know who Fritz Haber was, but you should! His process for turning atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia feeds billions today, and about half of the nitrogen atoms in your body come from his invention. His name has faded, but his work literally lives inside you.

To me, that is success: to create something so real, so lasting, that even when you are forgotten, your work continues transforming lives, feeding people, shaping minds, and living on in the world itself.

#### 💰 Wealth
**"What is your definition of wealth?"**

> Wealth is the freedom of choice.

<details>
<summary>Read my full answer</summary>

<br>

Wealth is control of time, comfort, and attention without bending your values. The opposite of wealth is compulsion: when bills, status games, or fear dictate your day. Money is a tool, not an identity; it should widen your options and strengthen your integrity.

Wealth has many factors, but material-wise, the test is simple: if more money would not change how you spend today, you are already operating from wealth. If it would, then you are still buying back control.

Wealth is not being paper-rich with no time for family or those you care about. And it is not endless time with the people you love but no resources to create the life you want. Nor is it having money but lacking the health, energy, or company to enjoy it.

Real wealth is the balance that gives you the time, the means, and the vitality to choose freely. It makes your life resilient to shocks, lets you walk away from bad deals, and funds work that matters to you while protecting the people you love. Wealth is quiet control, not loud consumption. It is having many doors open, and the clarity to walk through the ones that align with your values.

#### 🎯 Purpose
**"What is your purpose?"**

> My purpose is to take on hard problems that matter.

<details>
<summary>Read my full answer</summary>

<br>

Purpose is not comfort. To me, it is the pursuit of challenges that demand everything from you and, in return, shape who you become. If success is about leaving nothing undone and work that endures the test of time, and wealth is about the freedom to choose as I please, then purpose is the compass that makes those choices meaningful.

I see myself first as a problem-solver. Whether in research, technology, or life, my instinct is to wrestle with the impossible until it bends. But solving problems for its own sake is not enough. Purpose also means contribution: providing for my family, protecting those I love, and leaving behind ideas, stories, and work that last longer than my own lifetime.

The Chariot taught me something important: to stop is to regress. Purpose is pursuit. It is momentum. It is control over direction even when the path is uncertain. That is why I am drawn to mountains - both the ones of rock and ice, and the metaphorical ones. They remind me that life's meaning comes from stepping forward into difficulty, not away from it.

My purpose is to build, to solve, and to leave something behind that endures. If I can push against limits, take care of my people, and create work that still speaks when I am gone, then I have lived with purpose.
