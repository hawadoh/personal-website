# urss-blog

This is my personal blog for the URSS project on quantum cryptography, built using Hugo + PaperMod.

- 🧠 Goal: Build intuition for technical concepts, especially quantum cryptographic protocols
- 🛠️ Tech stack: Hugo + PaperMod + GitHub Pages
- 🌐 Live: [https://teaegg.net](https://teaegg.net)

To run locally:
```bash
hugo && hugo server
